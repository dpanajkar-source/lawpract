    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify">17.1 Sometimes, when you use the Services, you may (as a result of, or in connection with your use of the Services) use a service or download a piece of software, or purchase goods which are provided by another person or company. Your use of these other services, software or goods may be subject to separate terms between you and the company or person concerned. If so, the Terms do not affect your legal relationship with these other companies or individuals.</p>

      <p align="justify">17.4 You agree that if Lawpract does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy that is contained in the Terms (or which Lawpract has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Lawpract’s rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Lawpract.</p>
      <p align="justify">17.5 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of these Terms is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms.

      <p align="justify">18.2 From time to time, Lawpract may check with remote servers (hosted by Lawpract or by third parties) for available updates to extensions, including, but not limited to bug fixes or enhanced functionality.
